Note on COBOL parser: This is a very preliminary

direct user feedback, we want to get feedback 
in the form of bugs and defects to finally 
support COBOL for you!

Note for GUI: Using the GUI requires for you to 
have a blank fileList.txt in the location the GUI
Executable is created after building in Qt for
successful execution.
